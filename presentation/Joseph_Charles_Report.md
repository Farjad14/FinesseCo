# My most significant contribution to the project is creating the database and making database queries.

# A new concept that I learned during this project was how to develop a website. before the start of this project i had no previous knowlegde of web programming but after this project i have learned alot about html and javascript

# My main strengh as a team member is that i was motivated to work and able communicate ideas clearly

# My main weakness as a team member was that i had no web programming experience prior to this assingnment. Learning how to program in html and other web related languages was the biggest weakness i had.
