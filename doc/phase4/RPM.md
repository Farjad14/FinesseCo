### Practices:
We have been following various programming practices while we have been executing this project. Before actual implementation of our product, we have been doing rigorous planning between all group members for each piece of functionality that needs to be implemented. Additionally since there is an even number of members within our group we have been undergoing pair programming because members have been known to do well with implementation when we do pair programming. The code base has been being shared among all members of the group. Since whenever group members are working on the project, we are all doing it at the same time at one place rather than doing it at different times anymore.

### Harmful Practices:
Last week we identified that we were sending code to each other through Facebook messenger, which was a harmful practice. We have reduced the amount of code sharing via messenger, however we still do so from time to time. From last week we have been deciding to use github as well as working together at the same location in order to work on the project - and we are slowly integrating more through github.

### Worst Experience: 
The work experience since the beginning of the project was that we had an inactive group member that failed to contribute towards the project. At the beginning, we allowed his absence as he was busy with other schoolwork. However, even after they completed other school work, they still failed to contribute, or to even show up at meetings. We had to work really hard to convince the member to work with us.

### Best Experience: 
We are learning a lot about designing a web store
