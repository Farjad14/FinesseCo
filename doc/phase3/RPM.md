###Unfinished Tasks:
*We had created a login and a register page during our first sprint. <br />
During the interview with the TA, it was found that the login page was not functioning properly.
Upon realizing this problem, we had immediately taken charge towards completing this task.
We had used and MVC design architecture within our index page and used it as a controller in order to command the login verification to speak to our database.<br />

###Practices:
We have been following various programming practices while we have been executing this project. Before actual implementation of our product, we have been doing rigorous planning between all group members for each piece of functionality that needs to be implemented. Additionally since there is an even number of members within our group we have been undergoing pair programming because members have been known to do well with implementation when we do pair programming. The code base has been being shared among all members of the group. Since whenever group members are working on the project, we are all doing it at the same time at one place rather than doing it at different times anymore.

###Harmful Practices:
In order to work on different aspects of the project we have been sending code to each other through Facebook messenger so that when we have different parts of implementation completed, we must integrate these different parts into each other. From now we have been deciding to use github as well as working together at the same location in order to work on the project.

###Worst Experience: 
The work experience since the beginning of the project was that a large argument had ensued upon the discussion of the initial part of implementation of the project. This is the worst experience because during the start of the proejct so many members were lost and unsure on how to start. 

###Best Experience: 
Since all of my group members are well acquainted with each other, it is enjoyable to work with friends towards a project. My favourite experience was when we all worked one night towards sprint 1 and went out to eat burgers after.
