The team was organized through mutual friendships, and targeted skills through coursework. Tools used in order to contact with group members were using facebook. Decisions were made via mutual agreement through suggested ideas. User story points were defined through gathering group members and understanding requirements of each task. The rankings were also based on previous project experience with overlapping tasks. Point estimates were not decided through voting but group discussions in person. Group members were already previously acquainted, and had met in person. Lessons to take forward towards the next phase would be to make sure when discussing objectives, all group members should be present, so that group discussions can have more volume.
