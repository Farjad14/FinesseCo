# Reflection of Work

  This project has given all of us a new look on the way on how we interact with groups when working towards a single goal. As all of the members in our group are very close friends, we were able to understand more about each other as well as the software development process that comes along when creating a product. 

  In order to have an organized team, a variety of tools were used towards the completion of the project. A tool that worked well for us was the SCRUM development process. Our group had scheduled various team meetings so that we could be constantly updated on what the next steps in our project would be. 

  However, there were also tools that were used for our team that did not work well. Since we were using the MVC design architecture, the usage of PHP was necessary. PHP was installed on one members computer and they were constantly running into issues. The reason for this was that the version of PHP they had installed was outdated and did not comply with the code that other members had. This caused us to run into a problem, but was easily fixed after installing the newest version. 

  If our group were to continue working as at team, and design our process, our process would look more concentrated. For this project many members were working individually and not together within the same confined space. Continuing our project, we would make sure that even though members would be working on separate tasks, we would be making sure to update each other on what things we are behind on, what we are currently working on, and what are the next steps. 

  This project has created a lot of insights for our group members and made us understand more about the software development life cycle when it comes to the corporate world.
