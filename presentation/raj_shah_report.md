# What is your most significant individual contribution? #
My most significant contribution is making the database tables and the queries that can work with the controller. Made sure that the primary key for each table makes sense. 

# Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project. #
New concept that i learned on this project was the pivotal tracker, and making sure that each member will look at it every week.

# What is your main strength(s) as a team member? #
I would say that my biggest strength was my ability to get everybody together, and to make sure that everyone is understanding what to do for their parts.

# What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?) #
My main weakness as a team member is that since we were all friends, it was hard for me to yell at them and get their parts done asap.
