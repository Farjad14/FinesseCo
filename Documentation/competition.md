##Kijiji

###How our product is different
Our webstore supports shipping by acting as the middleman between trades. 

###Specific Scenario
The buyer sends payment directly to the webstore, and the product is either stored in our own warehouse, or is first sent to the warehouse, and then dispatched to the buyer. On the other hand, kijiji simply connects buyers and sellers by only providing contact details, but does not facilitate the trade itself. Our product is better as we offer a safer transcation for users, buy providing middleman services.
