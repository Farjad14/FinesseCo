#What is your most significant individual contribution?
* My most significant contribution to the project was that I played a big role with the CSS and overall look of the individual web pages that we created.

#Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

* A new concept that I learned was how to make CSS interact within the javascript for example making the views of the individual divs to be hidden or shown when an action occurs

#What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
* I believe my main strength as a team member was that I was able to split the work of the documentation as well as quickly having the design created, with clean CSS code.

#What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

* My main weakness as a team member is that I am not a quick learner. It takes me a while to learn a new skill like working with javascript. I had to make a login page working while being hidden and shown.
