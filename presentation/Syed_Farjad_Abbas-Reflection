#What is your most significant individual contribution?

My most significant contribution to the project was that I was managing the Controller aspect 
of the MVC concept, by controlling different view pages.

#Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.

- A new concept that I have learned while working on the project was that e-commerce websites should mainly be built by using RESTFUL API, and with the help
of MVC concept, it keeps the entire project organized.

#What is your main strength(s) as a team member?

I believe that my technical skills that I have learned from other courses such as CSC309 in terms of web development, 
I was able to use my skills and implement them in 301 Project


#What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

My main weakness is that I should have organised my time wisely, and I should've talked to professionals before starting any project like this
because it would save a lot of time if I get my research done before hand.
