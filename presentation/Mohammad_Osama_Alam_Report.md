* A new concept that I learned was how to create a system with multiple controllers working together.

* I believe my main strength as a team member was that I was able to lead the team by understanding tasks to be completed, and being able to effectively assign tasks to team members based on their technical skills. 

# What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
